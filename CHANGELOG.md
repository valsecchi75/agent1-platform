## [0.10.0-alpha] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Unified Dialog system**: shared modal primitives with rotating glow effect for all modals
- **Admin panel**: departments with real budgets, user spending analysis, system stats, safe restart
- **Template tag taxonomy**: tag management, template explorer with filter/grid/list views
- **Onboarding wizard**: 6-step tutorial with welcome modal and "don't show again" option
- **Node specs enriched**: all 29 foundation + custom node specs updated with full parameter definitions
- Node Pack enable/disable API routes (`/api/node-packs/disable`, `/api/node-packs/enable`)
- Dynamic ConnectionDropMenu using nodeSpecRegistry
- Pack version tracking in workflow files
- Template upsert support (GR-041)
- Full-snapshot backup before update (replaces 2-file backup)
- Download progress bar with percentage in update banner
- SSE heartbeat every 15s to prevent proxy timeouts
- "Skip this version" button with localStorage persistence

### Changed

- Morpheus pack renamed from `morpheus-model-management` to `agent1_morpheus_model_management` (GR-020)
- `.releaseinclude` updated for renamed pack directories (GR-045)
- `.gitignore` expanded to exclude temp/debug session artifacts and database files

### Fixed

- Incomplete rollback only restoring package.json + token.ts — now restores all whitelisted files
- Infinite build-retry loop after failed update — .update-pending marker cleaned on rollback
- Client spinner hanging forever when SSE connection drops silently
- Missing scripts/ directory in release ZIP (GR-016)
- `activeNodeTypes` empty race condition in "Check Missing" (GR-042)
- Registry JSON key mismatch `packs` vs `custom_nodes` (GR-037)

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Adaptive image resolution scaling — swaps full-res images for JPEG thumbnails when nodes are small on screen

### Fixed

- Router/switch passthrough losing data when multiple types (text + image) flow through the same router to one target
- SplitGrid node Split button permanently disabled — sourceImage now updates reactively when an edge is connected
- Node connection handles clipped at edges — removed paint containment that acted like overflow hidden
- Thumbnail cache key collisions causing wrong images on nodes
- Pending thumbnail map not cleaned up on rejection, causing stale entries
- Pointer-events on node images/content blocking pan and drag interactions
- Hover state updates firing during node drag, causing unnecessary re-renders
- Hover events not blocked during mouse-down drag
- backdrop-blur-sm causing poor rendering performance on Windows

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- Ensure auto-routed prompts retain correct individual item text
- Add rounded corners to ImageInput image and InlineParameterPanel settings

### Other

- Increase ArrayNode top padding to match side padding
- Add top padding and max-width to ArrayNode top fields
- Update ArrayNode layout to match new design language

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Provider Filter Icons** - ModelSearchDialog filters by available providers

### Fixed

- Ease curve outputDuration passthrough through parent-child connections
- Canvas hover state suppressed during panning to prevent re-render cascading
- Node click-to-select failures caused by d3-drag dead zone
